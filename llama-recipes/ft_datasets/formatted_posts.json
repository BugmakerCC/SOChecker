I firstly deploy contractA, and then deploy contractB using the contractA's address.\r\n\r\nWhen calling the `mint` function in contractB, `success` is always false, and I have no idea why this is failing. If I remove the `onlyOwner` from the `mint` function in contractA it starts working, so I believe it has something to do with this.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what's wrong here?\r\nThank you in advance.\n\n### Response:",

Here is my contract code:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract HoldNFT is ERC721, IERC721Receiver, ERC721Holder, Ownable{\r\n    using Counters for Counters.Counter;\r\n    Counters.Counter public _tokenIDs;\r\n    constructor() ERC721(\"HoldNFT\", \"HOLDNFT\") {\r\n        _tokenIDs.increment();\r\n    }\r\n    function send(IERC721 tokenAddress, uint256 tokenId) public {\r\n        uint256 current = _tokenIDs.current();\r\n        tokenAddress.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId); \r\n        _safeMint(recipient, current);\r\n        _tokenIDs.increment();  \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen I call on this function, I get the errow message \"Revert ERC721: transfer caller is not owner or approved\". My understanding is that this occurs because I am calling the safeTransferFrom function from a smart contract, so the msg.sender in the IERC721 contract (tokenAddress argument) is my smart contract instead of the user, who actually owns the token. I want to know if there is a way around this. I know that you can call the safeTransferFrom function or approve function from JavaScript so the msg.sender is the user. However, I don't think this will work in my particular case because the tokenAddress is arbitary (decided by the user) so I do not have access to the ABI in development. What should I do?\r\n\r\nP.S. The template I used for this project was from a dApp called nftysanta (0x1f4E4eF54dB90934DE8fB2d68438C68660099Ad4). It seems to use the same implementation as far as I can see? And I assumed that it works because it's a verified contract on mainnet.\n\n### Response:",

But then when sending the tokens, I will need to divide by 1e18 which would defeat the purpose of doing that.\r\n\r\nNot sure what the best method for this\n\n### Response:",

Following along with Chainlink's documentation (https://docs.chain.link/docs/advanced-tutorial/) I deployed this contract onto the Rinkeby testnet. \r\n\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.7;\r\n\r\nimport \"github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/ChainlinkClient.sol\";\r\n\r\n// MyContract inherits the ChainlinkClient contract to gain the\r\n// functionality of creating Chainlink requests\r\n\r\n\r\ncontract getHTTP is ChainlinkClient {\r\n  using Chainlink for Chainlink.Request;\r\n\r\n  bytes32 private thisDoesNotWork;\r\n  address private owner;\r\n  address private ORACLE_ADDRESS = 0x718Cc73722a2621De5F2f0Cb47A5180875f62D60;\r\n  bytes32 private JOBID = stringToBytes32(\"86b489ec4d84439c96181a8df7b22223\");\r\n  string private url = \"<myHTTPAddressAsString>\"; \r\n\r\n// This endpoint URL is hard coded in my contract, and stored as a string (as in the example code). \r\n// I control it and can have it reply with whatever I want, which might be an issue, returning data in a format that the oracle rejects\r\n\r\n  uint256 constant private ORACLE_PAYMENT = 100000000000000000;\r\n\r\n  constructor() public {\r\n    // Set the address for the LINK token for the network\r\n    setPublicChainlinkToken();\r\n    owner = msg.sender;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function requestBytes() \r\n    public\r\n    onlyOwner\r\n  {\r\n    Chainlink.Request memory req = buildChainlinkRequest(JOBID, address(this), this.fulfill.selector);\r\n    req.add(\"get\", url);\r\n    sendChainlinkRequestTo(ORACLE_ADDRESS, req, ORACLE_PAYMENT);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function fulfill(bytes32 _requestId, bytes32 recVal)\r\n    public\r\n    recordChainlinkFulfillment(_requestId)\r\n  {\r\n    thisDoesNotWork = recVal;\r\n  }\r\n  function cancelRequest(\r\n    bytes32 _requestId,\r\n    uint256 _payment,\r\n    bytes4 _callbackFunctionId,\r\n    uint256 _expiration\r\n  )\r\n    public\r\n    onlyOwner\r\n  {\r\n    cancelChainlinkRequest(_requestId, _payment, _callbackFunctionId, _expiration);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  \r\n  // withdrawLink allows the owner to withdraw any extra LINK on the contract\r\n  function withdrawLink()\r\n    public\r\n    onlyOwner\r\n  {\r\n    LinkTokenInterface link = LinkTokenInterface(chainlinkTokenAddress());\r\n    require(link.transfer(msg.sender, link.balanceOf(address(this))), \"Unable to transfer\");\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  modifier onlyOwner() {\r\n    require(msg.sender == owner);\r\n    _;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n   // A helper funciton to make the string a bytes32\r\n  function stringToBytes32(string memory source) private pure returns (bytes32 result) {\r\n    bytes memory tempEmptyStringTest = bytes(source);\r\n    if (tempEmptyStringTest.length == 0) {\r\n      return 0x0;\r\n    }\r\n    assembly { // solhint-disable-line no-inline-assembly\r\n      result := mload(add(source, 32))\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI found a node on the Chainlink market (https://market.link/jobs/529c7194-c665-4b30-8d25-5321ea49d9cc) that is currently active on rinkeby (according to Etherscan it has been active within the past 3 days and presumably still working). \r\n\r\nI deploy the contract and fund the contract with LINK. I call the requestBytes() function through remix and everything works as expected. Metamask pays the gas, the LINK is removed from my contract, I get a transaction hash, and no errors. \r\n\r\nHowever, my endpoint never logs a request attempt, the oracle never lists a transaction on its Etherscan page, and my data is not present.\r\n\r\nI have attempted to use other jobs from the Chainlink market with similar outcomes.\r\n\r\nI have also attempted to use other HTTP endpoints, like the ones from the Chainlink examples, with similar outcomes, however I doubt this is the issue, since it appears the HTTP request is never even getting called (as referenced by the fact that my HTTP endpoint does not log the request) \r\n\r\nWithout an error message, and being new to Web3 dev, I am not sure where to start debugging. I found this comment on Github: https://github.com/smartcontractkit/documentation/issues/513 and implemented the suggestion here without luck.\r\n\r\nI also found this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67880818/chainlink-job-not-being-fulfilled but this was not helpful either.\r\n\r\nMy current considerations for where the error might be: \r\n\r\n1. The oracles are whitelisted and reject my request outright. Have considered creating my own node but want to avoid if possible at this stage. \r\n\r\n2. I have an type error in how I am formatting the request in my contract, like the example in the GitHub exchange I found and referenced above. \r\n\r\nEDIT: I am also open to other options beyond Chainlink to connect my contract to an HTTP GET endpoint, if anyone has any suggestions.

[Opensea][1] uses [wyvern protocol][2] for NFT order matching (atomicMatch). According to my understanding the current NFT token trade flow *(simplified)* on opensea is as follows \r\n    \r\n***Seller***  \r\nSeller clicks sell for the first time on opensea  \r\nSetApprovalForAll triggers allowing the operator (proxy account) to operate on all of his tokens.  \r\nSeller list an nft for sale by sending Signed message that approves operator to transfer that specific nft on owners' behalf when properly matched with buy order.     \r\n\r\n***Buyer***   \r\nBuyer clicks buy on listed NFT -> AtomicMatch Triggers.  \r\n**`AtomicMatch()`**  \r\nVerifies already signed order and Match both buy and sell orders.  \r\n`executeFundsTransfer(buy, sell);` Transfer funds and fees. `returns price` for which asset is being sold/bought for.\r\ncall or delegatecall `safeTransferFrom()` of nft contract to transfer asset\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I only have control over the very last step `safeTransferFrom()` how can I know in that function that how much ether value/price the asset is being sold for and obviously then I can prevent it from being sold under a specific price\r\n\r\nThe whole process is one single transaction so I believe there should be some way to access the data of `executeFundsTransfer()` or any workaround for this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://opensea.io/\r\n  [2]: https://wyvernprotocol.com/docs\n\n### Response:",

Here is the contract:\r\n\r\n    pragma \"^0.7.0\";\r\n    \r\n    interface DoubleTrade {};  //<<==declare DoubleTrade. Is it the right way to declare ??? Do I need to declare getter function for public variable to be accessed? \r\n\r\n    contract Escrow {\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    constructor () payable {\r\n    ...\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function getValueFromDoubleTrade(address _doubleTradeContractAddress) external returns \r\n    (uint256) {\r\n       DoubleTrade _double = DoubleTrade(_doubleTradeContractAddress);\r\n       return _double.value();  //<<== value is a public variable in contract DoubleTrade\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nIs the code above going to work in solidity?\n\n### Response:",

What do they represent?** In the source code, it just says token name and token symbol.\r\n\r\n**Are they the name and symbol of an NFT?** *(Do NFTs have unique names & symbols?)*\r\n- If so, then won't every NFT I mint using that contract have the same name and symbol?\r\n- Where do I specify the name of the collection that it belongs to?\r\n\r\nOr **are they the name and symbol of the collection to which the NFT belongs too?** So that after I deploy the contract, every NFT I mint has that collection name and symbol.\r\n- I was looking at the contract of an NFT on OpenSea - [link][1] - and the name and symbol were of the collection that it belongs to (Kitty Crypto Gang (KCG)).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is sample code from [openzeppelin][2]. **The constructor is in line 8.**\r\n```\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol\";\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract GameItem is ERC721URIStorage {\r\n    using Counters for Counters.Counter;\r\n    Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;\r\n\r\n    constructor() ERC721(\"GameItem\", \"ITM\") {} // constructor is here <---------------------\r\n\r\n    function awardItem(address player, string memory tokenURI)\r\n        public\r\n        returns (uint256)\r\n    {\r\n        _tokenIds.increment();\r\n\r\n        uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();\r\n        _mint(player, newItemId);\r\n        _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);\r\n\r\n        return newItemId;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, do NFTs have to be part of a collection?

There are only collections.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://etherscan.io/address/0xa302f0d51a365b18e86c291056dc265a73f19419#code\r\n  [2]: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721#constructing_an_erc721_token_contract\n\n### Response:",

Please take a PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT in mind while answering the question. How do the industry giants achieve it? \r\n\r\nCase 1: Hardcoding the IPFS URLs in the contract itself before minting begins.\r\n===\r\nThis seems to be the easiest way. I can upload the metadata of each token to IPFS (using Pinata or something else) and get the URLs which **I can then hardcode as a mapping in the contract itself**. Then, I can internally call `_setTokenURI()` method to set the metadata of the token being minted in my `mintNFT()` function.  \r\n\r\n    mapping(uint => string) public ipfsURLs;  // Hardcode URLs here\r\n    function mintNFT() public payable \r\n        {\r\n            _tokenIds.increment();  // Counter\r\n            uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();\r\n            _mint(msg.sender, newItemId);\r\n            string memory tokenURI = ipfsURLs[newItemId];\r\n            _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nPros: I won't have to pay the gas fees while setting the metadata as it is set in the `mintNFT()` function, i.e. the gas is deducted from the wallet of the user who is minting the token.  \r\nCons: The problem with this approach is that all the tokenURIs will be visible to everyone who reads the contract and people might take unfair advantage of that.\r\n\r\nCase 2: Setting the metadata as the minting is going on\r\n===\r\n\r\nIn the `mintNFT()` function, I can emit an event with `tokenId` as the parameter. Then, in my JS code, I can **watch for the event and call a function that sets the tokenURI** of the the minted token, which I'll get from my database.\r\n\r\n\r\n    event MintComplete(uint tokenId, address owner);\r\n    function mintNFT() public payable\r\n        {\r\n            _tokenIds.increment();\r\n            uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();\r\n            _mint(msg.sender, newItemId);\r\n            emit MintComplete(newItemId, msg.sender);\r\n        }\r\n    function setURI(uint256 id, string memory ipfsURI)\r\n            public onlyOwner // called from a script when above event emitted \r\n        {\r\n            _setTokenURI(id, ipfsURI);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nPros: The metadata IPFS URLs are not visible in the contract before the token is minted. This will act as a good security measure in maintaining randomness of minting.  \r\nCons: User will pay the gas fees for `mintNFT()` method, and the contract owner will have to pay the gas fees for calling `setURI()` method. More the number of tokens (~1000s), more the contract owner will have to pay in Gas fees.\r\n\r\nCase 3: Setting the metadata after the minting process is complete\r\n===\r\n\r\nAfter the minting process is over and all the tokens have been minted, I can send the mapping of tokenId to IPFS URLs to a contract function in a single transaction (or in batches of say 100 URLs per transaction).\r\n\r\n    function setURI(uint256 startIndex, string[] memory listOfIpfsURI)\r\n                public onlyOwner // called after batch minting over\r\n        {\r\n               for (index = startIndex; index < listOfIpfsURI.length; index++) {\r\n                   _setTokenURI(index, listOfIpfsURI[index-startIndex]);\r\n               }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nPros: Same as Case 2.  \r\nCons: Same as Case 2, but Gas fees is lower due to lower number of calls to `setURI()`. Also, people might have to wait for the reveal till the batch size is complete, which can take a lot of time in some cases.  \r\n\r\nCase 4: Any other method ...\r\n===\r\n\r\nIn case there exists a better method which I haven't listed above, please include it with an example code if possible. Also, if anyone has any idea how the big NFT collections (BoredApes etc.) do it, please shed some light on that as well.\n\n### Response:",

I noticed that the cost of the push of array in solidity keeps the same. If we have a dynamic array, we must have a point where the length of the array will be doubled and the data will be copied. In this case, the gas cost will be larger. How can solidity make cost of push constant? Does solidity make a very large array in the initialization and then the push cost can be constant?\n\n### Response:",

Here's what I came up with so far:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nvm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSignature(\"MyCustomError()\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works since the `expectRevert` cheatcode is implemented in three different ways:\r\n\r\n - `expectRevert()`\r\n - `expectRevert(bytes calldata)`\r\n - `expectRevert(bytes4)`\r\n\r\nBut using `abi.encodeWithSignature` feels like going in a roundabout way. I tried to reference the custom error directly:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nvm.expectRevert(MyInterface.MyCustomError);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this doesn't compile, so it follows that `MyCustomError` is neither `bytes` nor `bytes4` when referenced like this. That's fine. But then, what type is it, and could I cast it to either `bytes` or `bytes4`?\n\n### Response:",

Here is the function for somebody answering the bounty. I am trying to figure out when it is better to cast to payable, it seems intuitively that always keeping an address type default and casting it just before a transfer would defeat the point of having types in the first place.\r\n\r\n# Code\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  function answerBounty(\r\n    uint _bountyId,\r\n    string memory _answerId)\r\n    public\r\n    validateBountyArrayIndex(_bountyId)\r\n  {\r\n    bounties[_bountyId].hasBeenAnswered = true;\r\n    bounties[_bountyId].fulfillments.push(Fulfillment(_answerId, msg.sender, block.timestamp));\r\n    uint answerIndex = bounties[_bountyId].fulfillments.length - 1;\r\n\r\n    emit BountyFulfilled(_bountyId, msg.sender, _answerId, answerIndex);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Issue\r\n\r\nI know that msg.sender default type is 'address'. If this answer is selected, the msg.sender that is stored in the the contract at that line:\r\n```js \r\nbounties[_bountyId].fulfillments.push(Fulfillment(_answerId, msg.sender, block.timestamp));\r\n```\r\nwill be sent the funds of the bounty. Just taking the address from Fulfillment and calling .transfer() would cause an error because msg.sender is type 'address'. So it needs to be cast to payable before calling .transfer().\r\n\r\n# Question\r\n\r\nIs it better to to cast or declare an address to payable as soon as possible if we know it might receive funds later, or is it better to wait just before we need to transfer it funds and cast it to payable?\n\n### Response:",

I was reading solidity by example docs [here][1] and I've found this code:\r\n```\r\n/// signature methods.\r\n    function splitSignature(bytes memory sig)\r\n        internal\r\n        pure\r\n        returns (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)\r\n    {\r\n        require(sig.length == 65);\r\n\r\n        assembly {\r\n            // first 32 bytes, after the length prefix.\r\n            r := mload(add(sig, 32))\r\n            // second 32 bytes.\r\n            s := mload(add(sig, 64))\r\n            // final byte (first byte of the next 32 bytes).\r\n            v := byte(0, mload(add(sig, 96)))\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return (v, r, s);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nWhy does it work?

Let's say I have a view function in Solidity which does some operations and returns a result. Now I connect to a node and invoke this function on my contract. Where is this function actually executed? I'm assuming it's executed in the node I'm against. But let's say that this function is behaving very badly somehow in usual programming sense. For example it does some heavy computations like calculates prime numbers or something. Or let's say it's just an infinite recursion like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction my_func() public view returns(uint) {\r\n    if (1 == 0) {\r\n       return 0;\r\n    }\r\n    return this.my_func()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf something like this would be run on a node and since there is no gas involved as no transaction was created then I could potentially cause a lot of harm to the node wouldn't I? How does node protect itself from that?\n\n### Response:",

Instead of using delegate call to call a function, it\r\n    simply uses JUMP statement(normal method call). There is no need to\r\n    separately deploy library in this scenario.\r\n\r\n 2. **Linked Library** : On the flip side, if a library contain public or\r\n    external functions then library needs to be deployed. Deployment of\r\n    library will generate unique address in blockchain. This address\r\n    needs to be linked with calling contract.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see, if there is a functionality/code that will be identical over many SmartContracts, we should write **Linked Library** to avoid code duplication and thus save gas. We deploy such a library and link it to all the contracts that need to use its logic. \r\n\r\nSo what is then the point of **Embedded Library**??\r\n\r\nBecause, from what I can see, we don't deploy **Embedded Library** because the compiler will basically copy-paste its code into all the smart-contracts using it. So why just not write the code in SC and save yourself the trouble? (I guess it could make your code look cleaner, but that is about it) \r\n\r\n \r\nOr am I missing something here? At the moment, **Linked Library** seems to have an obvious use case, while I can't find any situation where I would use **Embedded Library** instead. So I hope someone with more experience can explain this to me.  \r\n\r\n\r\nLink to relevant article -> [All you should know about libraries in solidity][1]\r\n\r\n[Another good article on how to downsize your SmartContracts by using Library][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://medium.com/coinmonks/all-you-should-know-about-libraries-in-solidity-dd8bc953eae7\r\n  [2]: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/downsizing-contracts-to-fight-the-contract-size-limit/\n\n### Response:",

Set approval on **contract1** for each token to be burned, then call the `burn` method of **contract1** from **contract2** for each token.\r\n 2.

And it gives an exception case that when the packed variables in a single slot are not read or written at the same time, it actually costs more gas because \"the storage slot has to be read first and then combined with the new value\". \r\n\r\nMy question is since we almost never read or write packed variables in a single slot at the same time, why do we still try packing these variables together? The alternative is just to use a single slot for each reduced-size variable, in which case EVM will need to run additional operations to reduce 32 bytes data to its desired size. Given that both single-slot storage and multi-slot storage have disadvantages in extra gas costs, how do we know for sure which way of storage costs less gas? Thank you!\r\n\r\nSee quotes from solidity doc.'s warning:\r\n\r\n> When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contract’s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.\r\n> \r\n> **It might be beneficial to use reduced-size types if you are dealing**\r\n> with storage values because the compiler will pack multiple elements\r\n> into one storage slot, and thus, combine multiple reads or writes into\r\n> a single operation. **If you are not reading or writing all the values**\r\n> **in a slot at the same time, this can have the opposite effect, though**:\r\n> When one value is written to a multi-value storage slot, the storage\r\n> slot has to be read first and then combined with the new value such\r\n> that other data in the same slot is not destroyed...\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/internals/layout_in_storage.html#storage-inplace-encoding\n\n### Response:",

In my mind, the blockchain has its native currency which provides the means for a payable function, which I assume is the transfer of value from an address like a wallet to another like a contract.\r\n\r\nThe blockchain holds the facts of these transfers. So why would a smart contract keep track of how much has been received?\r\n\r\nThis duplicates state and is WET code (latent bugs); I assume there's no built-in function to ask the blockchain what the balance is for a particular contract, else why would one track it and open up the chance of programmer error?\r\n\r\nI'd be grateful if someone could explain what I've misunderstood, thank you.\n\n### Response:",

Or, is it even possible to emit and then parse a custom struct from the event args?\r\n\r\nI'm working on a generational NFT minting solidity contract which tracks each generation via a counter and a mapping of an internally defined struct `GenInfo`:\r\n```\r\n// Generation Counter\r\nuint256 private s_generationCounter;\r\n\r\n// Generation Struct\r\nstruct GenInfo {\r\n    uint256 mintPrice;\r\n    uint256 mintCap;\r\n    uint256 supplyCap;\r\n    uint256 startTime;\r\n    string metadataCID;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Mapping of generation number to GenInfo\r\nmapping(uint256 => GenInfo) s_generationInfo;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn event is emitted with 2 indexed parameters when a new generation is created:\r\n```\r\nevent NewGenerationCreated(\r\n    uint256 indexed generation,\r\n    GenInfo indexed genInfo\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am using ethers.js to submit the transaction and fetch the transaction receipt and would like to be able to decode the values within the indexed `GenInfo` struct emitted with the `NewGenerationCreated` event into a readable JavaScript object:\r\n```\r\n// createGenerationTxReceipt.events[0].args\r\n[\r\n  BigNumber { _hex: '0x01', _isBigNumber: true },\r\n  {\r\n    _isIndexed: true,\r\n    hash: '0xc7ca7439fa64d98b58ae965bc052bcf154fcb3f7deec49e026bc7091c4fb4d72',\r\n    constructor: [Function: Indexed] { isIndexed: [Function (anonymous)] }\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can reconstruct the first param (`uint256 generation`) with\r\n```\r\nconst newGeneration = creatGenerationTxReceipt.events[0].args[0].toNumber()\r\n\r\n// newGeneration = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**However, I'm having difficulty figuring out how to parse or decode the data format of the second parameter, my custom `GenInfo` struct, into a JavaScript object.**\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst genInfo = creatGenerationTxReceipt.events[0].args[1]\r\n\r\n// genInfo - how to parse this into a JavaScript object?\r\n{\r\n  _isIndexed: true,\r\n  hash: '0xc7ca7439fa64d98b58ae965bc052bcf154fcb3f7deec49e026bc7091c4fb4d72',\r\n  constructor: [Function: Indexed] { isIndexed: [Function (anonymous)] }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried using the interface associated with the contract to parse the logs but still just receive the same opaque object:\r\n```\r\nconst data = creatGenerationTxReceipt.events[0].data\r\nconst topics = creatGenerationTxReceipt.events[0].topics\r\n\r\nconst logDescription = generationalNftContract.interface.parseLog({ data, topics })\r\n\r\n// logDescripton.args\r\n[\r\n  BigNumber { _hex: '0x01', _isBigNumber: true },\r\n  {\r\n    _isIndexed: true,\r\n    hash: '0x88f9f72724878230f7fe58eaf66cb38f2b5c3ba477c38faf1be850482903ec51',\r\n    constructor: [Function]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the ABI of the contract, I can see that the NewGenerationCreated event has an input that matches the internalType of the struct: \r\n```\r\n{\r\n      \"anonymous\": false,\r\n      \"inputs\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"indexed\": true,\r\n          \"internalType\": \"uint256\",\r\n          \"name\": \"generation\",\r\n          \"type\": \"uint256\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"components\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"internalType\": \"uint256\",\r\n              \"name\": \"mintPrice\",\r\n              \"type\": \"uint256\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              \"internalType\": \"uint256\",\r\n              \"name\": \"mintCap\",\r\n              \"type\": \"uint256\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              \"internalType\": \"uint256\",\r\n              \"name\": \"supplyCap\",\r\n              \"type\": \"uint256\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              \"internalType\": \"uint256\",\r\n              \"name\": \"startTime\",\r\n              \"type\": \"uint256\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              \"internalType\": \"string\",\r\n              \"name\": \"metadataCID\",\r\n              \"type\": \"string\"\r\n            }\r\n          ],\r\n          \"indexed\": true,\r\n          \"internalType\": \"struct GenerationalNftContract.GenInfo\",\r\n          \"name\": \"genInfo\",\r\n          \"type\": \"tuple\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"name\": \"NewGenerationCreated\",\r\n      \"type\": \"event\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis gives me the impression that there is a way to decode the output of the event args to reconstruct this input data from the `struct GenerationalNftContract.GenInfo` internalType to an object comprised of the struct's key/values by their internalType. However, in all my googling and reading through the ethers.js and solidity docs I'm unable to find a suitable method to parse this data.\r\n\r\nAny help on this would be much appreciated!\n\n### Response:",

After executing once, the gas spent on the following txs drops quite a lot, with second case still being slightly expensive than the first.\r\n\r\nMy instinct is that this is relevant to storing something for the first time in mapping, and caching if a key's hash (or however the position of the value is determined) is already calculated previously.\r\n\r\nBut I could not find a detailed information about this. I would appreciate if anyone could explain the reasoning behind this behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n**PS:** I tested this on Avalanche-Fuji. I used Remix IDE to both deploy and run the contract. I used Metamask as my wallet provider. The optimization was enabled with 10000000 runs. EVM version was default.\n\n### Response:",

Also I wanted this choice to be decided at random so the minter doesn't know what type of NFT they'll get. I followed this NFT as a guide https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/nft-mix/blob/main/contracts/AdvancedCollectible.sol. The only significant change that I made was switching Chainlink to API3 as my random number provider. I used a basic API3 implementation to get the random number like this https://github.com/Ashar2shahid/eth-denver-hackathon/blob/master/contracts/Requester.sol.

It mints the NFT with a random `Classifier` when you call `requestRandomSurfaceReachT1`. The only problem is that I don't understand how `requestRandomSurfaceReachT1` automatically calls `mintSurfaceReacher`. The first time I called `requestRandomSurfaceReachT1` from hardhat I was shocked when I saw that `mintSurfaceReacher` also ran!  \r\n\r\nI was thinking that `requestRandomSurfaceReachT1` would just spit out a random number and I would have to design some automated way to feed it into `mintSurfaceReacher` or something, but low and behold `mintSurfaceReacher` ran anyway. So how is `mintSurfaceReacher` running when I call `requestRandomSurfaceReachT1`? I don't see `mintSurfaceReacher` being called in `requestRandomSurfaceReachT1`?\n\n### Response:",

I know the functionality should be fine regardless as all these Pair Liquidity pool contracts are deployed as separate contracts but it seemed a little odd to me that the name and symbol couldn't just be set as something like \"DAI-ETH LP\" in the constructor rather than all as the same \"uniswap v2\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\n\n### Response:",

Does either variation cost more gas? Is one the more standard practice? I've seen examples of both being used.\r\n\r\nVariation 1:\r\n\r\n    contract MyNFT is ERC721Enumerable, PaymentSplitter, Ownable {\r\n        using Counters for Counters.Counter;\r\n        Counters.Counter private currentTokenId;\r\n    ...\r\n    \r\n    function mint(uint256 _count)\r\n            public payable\r\n    {\r\n        uint256 tokenId = currentTokenId.current();\r\n        require(tokenId < MAX_SUPPLY, \"Max supply reached\");\r\n        for(uint i = 0; i < _count; ++i){\r\n            currentTokenId.increment();\r\n            uint256 newItemId = currentTokenId.current();\r\n            _safeMint(msg.sender, newItemId);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nVariation 2:\r\n\r\n    function mint(uint256 _count)\r\n            public payable\r\n    {\r\n        uint supply = totalSupply();\r\n        require( supply + _count <= MAX_SUPPLY, \"Exceeds max supply.\" );\r\n        for(uint i = 0; i < _count; ++i){\r\n            _safeMint(msg.sender, supply + i);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBoth versions seem to work. I just want to be sure I'm using the most efficient / secure. Thanks for any advice!\n\n### Response:",

I rely on checking the 'from' and 'to' for being uniswap pairs (V2 or V3) to detect it as a buy/sell transaction.\r\nFor V2, it's fairly simply as I can use factory function to get the pair address. But for V3 pools, there are more combinations and more fees may be added in the future. So I want to programmatically check if the 'from' or 'to' address has a 'token0' funtion using address.staticcall().\r\nThe problem is staticcall() just fails with revert if the 'token0' function does not exists, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Anyway to help detect that address is a pair/pool without reverting would work.\r\nHere is the code I am using (from github) - this code is calling symbol() function\r\nThis call may revert if the function called is not existing in the contract\r\nHere I am calling symbol(), but potentially can call token0() or any other function\r\n```   \r\nfunction _isUniswapV2Pair(address target) internal view returns (bool) {\r\n       address token0;\r\n       address token1;\r\n\r\n       string memory targetSymbol = _callAndParseStringReturn(\r\n           target,\r\n           hex&quot;95d89b41&quot; // symbol()\r\n       );\r\n\r\n       if (bytes(targetSymbol).length == 0) {\r\n           return false;\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       if (_compare(targetSymbol, &quot;UNI-V2&quot;)) {\r\n           IUniswapV2Pair pairContract = IUniswapV2Pair(target);\r\n\r\n           try pairContract.token0() returns (address _token0) {\r\n               token0 = _token0;\r\n           } catch Error(string memory) {\r\n               return false;\r\n           } catch (bytes memory) {\r\n               return false;\r\n           }\r\n\r\n           try pairContract.token1() returns (address _token1) {\r\n               token1 = _token1;\r\n           } catch Error(string memory) {\r\n               return false;\r\n           } catch (bytes memory) {\r\n               return false;\r\n           }\r\n       } else {\r\n           return false;\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       return target == _dexFactoryV2.getPair(token0, token1);    }\r\n\r\n    function _callAndParseStringReturn(address token, bytes4 selector)\r\n       internal\r\n       view\r\n       returns (string memory)\r\n      {\r\n       (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.staticcall(\r\n           abi.encodeWithSelector(selector)\r\n       );\r\n\r\n       // if not implemented, or returns empty data, return empty string\r\n       if (!success || data.length == 0) {\r\n           return &quot;&quot;;\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       // bytes32 data always has length 32\r\n       if (data.length == 32) {\r\n           bytes32 decoded = abi.decode(data, (bytes32));\r\n           return _bytes32ToString(decoded);\r\n       } else if (data.length &gt; 64) {\r\n           return abi.decode(data, (string));\r\n       }\r\n       return &quot;&quot;;    }\r\n   \r\n    function _bytes32ToString(bytes32 x) internal pure returns (string memory) {\r\n       bytes memory bytesString = new bytes(32);\r\n       uint256 charCount = 0;\r\n       for (uint256 j = 0; j &lt; 32; j++) {\r\n           bytes1 char = x[j];\r\n           if (char != 0) {\r\n               bytesString[charCount] = char;\r\n               charCount++;\r\n           }\r\n       }\r\n       bytes memory bytesStringTrimmed = new bytes(charCount);\r\n       for (uint256 j = 0; j &lt; charCount; j++) {\r\n           bytesStringTrimmed[j] = bytesString[j];\r\n       }\r\n       return string(bytesStringTrimmed);    }\r\n```\r\nI have studied the solidity documentation and explored using assembly functions to detect contract name, but looks like that's not possible.\r\nAlso tried several approaches to avoid revert from staticcall if the called function is not existing. There are several contracts that get passed to transfer in case of uniswap swaps - it could be SwapRouter, or NFPosManager or custom tokens or any other contract.\r\nFYI I do check if the address is a contract and not a wallet address before making this above call.\n\n### Response:",

I'm not sure what I'm missing.\r\n\r\nLet's say I have a contract with a mapping and I would like to know the storage slot location for a particular key and be able to access it directly from something like `web3.eth.getStorageAt(contractAddress, mappingKeyIndexInStorage)`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.16;\r\n\r\ncontract MappingStorage {\r\n\r\n    mapping(address => uint) public balances;\r\n\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        balances[0x6827b8f6cc60497d9bf5210d602C0EcaFDF7C405] = 678;\r\n        balances[0x66B0b1d2930059407DcC30F1A2305435fc37315E] = 501; \r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function getStorageLocationForKey(address _key, uint256 p) public pure returns(bytes32) {\r\n        // There is no straight foward way in solidity to concatenate 2 values, so I'm trying encoding here.\r\n        bytes memory encoded = abi.encode(_key, p);\r\n        return keccak256(encoded);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `getStorageLocationForKey` function is just an utility that I would like to use to derive this storage slot index from using Solidity.\r\n\r\nSince the key is an address, I left padded the address to have a 32 bytes value:\r\n\r\n> 0x000000000000000000000006827b8f6cc60497d9bf5210d602C0EcaFDF7C4050\r\n\r\nSince the mapping, in this case, is declared at storage slot position `0`, I padded it to 32 bytes:\r\n\r\n> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n\r\nConcatenating them without the `0x` prefix:\r\n\r\n> 0000000000000000000000006827b8f6cc60497d9bf5210d602C0EcaFDF7C4050000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n\r\nAnd its `keccak256` hash:\r\n\r\n> 6ccfcacc19c8d102cc5880b825323e63defac7b2ba969c7dc33950b298248835\r\n\r\nYou can try the `keccak256` here: https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html\r\n\r\nI try:\r\n\r\n> web3.eth.getStorageAt(contractAddress, \"0x6ccfcacc19c8d102cc5880b825323e63defac7b2ba969c7dc33950b298248835\")\r\n\r\nAnd it returns `0x` bytes. I'm expecting to get the `678` value which is what it's saved at that address key.\r\n\r\nI'm I missing something?\r\n\r\nI would like to see a solution implemented in Solidity.\r\n\r\nHere is an instance of this contract deployed in Rinkeby testnet: \r\n\r\n> 0xC216FdC8fb87A151d69313e18a80a58bebBA7267\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/internals/layout_in_storage.html#mappings-and-dynamic-arrays\r\n\r\n  [2]: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/49873/how-to-derive-the-storage-key-of-mapping-to-an-account/59663#59663\n\n### Response:",

We intend to deploy this contract multiple times, and in certain cases, flash loan capabilities are not required.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution is to implement a `paused` flag. When set to true, this flag would deactivate the `flashLoan` function. But this approach seems inefficient, as it retains the unnecessary ERC-3156 features in contracts that will never use them.\r\n\r\nIs there a more elegant method for selectively including logic in a contract during its construction?\r\n\r\nThis is what I have in mind:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Foo {\r\n    constructor(bool flag) {\r\n        if (flag) {\r\n            // include ERC-3156 logic\r\n        } else {\r\n            // do not include ERC-3156 logic\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n - I don't want two different contract names\r\n - By \"not including\", I mean for the `flashLoan` function to not exist\r\n - I am deploying the contracts with [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting)\n\n### Response:",

In a flash, however, I was wondered what is the best practice of copying from array to array in Solidity.\r\n\r\nI present two option. One is copying by pointer (I guess) and the other is using for-loop.\r\n\r\n**TestOne.sol**\r\n```sol\r\ncontract TestContract {\r\n    uint32[4] testArray;\r\n\r\n    constructor(uint32[4] memory seeds) {\r\n        testArray = seeds; // execution costs: 152253\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function Show() public returns (uint32[4] memory) {\r\n        return testArray;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**TestTwo.sol**\r\n```sol\r\ncontract TestContract {\r\n    uint32[4] testArray;\r\n\r\n    constructor(uint32[4] memory seeds) {\r\n        for(uint i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\r\n            testArray[i] = seeds[i];  // execution costs: 150792\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function Show() public returns (uint32[4] memory) {\r\n        return testArray;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tested with Remix (Ethereum Online IDE), 0.8.13 Solidity Compiler with Enable optimization (200)\r\n\r\n## Discussion of test result\r\n\r\nWe can see that, TestOne used **152253 gas** for execution costs, and TestTwo used **150792 gas** for execution costs.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing is that, **for-loop** used less gas than just assigning pointer. In my little thought, for-loop would be more assembly codes than the other. (There would be, at least, assigning ```uint i```, substitute 4 times, check conditions 4 times (whether ```i < 4```), increase ```i++``` 4 times etc.)\r\n\r\nI suspected the \"optimization\" of solidity compiler. But, after doing same small experiment without \"Enable optimization\", it does same result that for-loop used less gas. (198846 vs. 198464)\r\n\r\n**The Question is**\r\n\r\n1. Why do above things happened?\r\n\r\n2. What is the best practice of copying from array to array? Is there any copy function like C++'s ```std::copy()``` ?\n\n### Response:",

Instead on `const user`, I'm having the transaction metadata, as follow: \r\n```\r\n{hash: '0x24818569ec29d328b66f58736750a420a5a3bd8e28a72a6a0f72fd8ba5e088d8', type: 2, accessList: null, blockHash: null, blockNumber: null, …}\r\naccessList: null\r\nblockHash: null\r\nblockNumber: null\r\nchainId: 0\r\nconfirmations: 0\r\ncreates: null\r\ndata: \"0x6f77926b00000000000000000000000086b2b772014a87730928c7e54f4762d2c09ea4e5\"\r\nfrom: \"0x86b2b772014A87730928c7e54F4762d2c09eA4e5\"\r\ngasLimit: BigNumber {_hex: '0xd15f', _isBigNumber: true}\r\ngasPrice: BigNumber {_hex: '0x73a20d0c', _isBigNumber: true}\r\nhash: \"0x24818569ec29d328b66f58736750a420a5a3bd8e28a72a6a0f72fd8ba5e088d8\"\r\nmaxFeePerGas: BigNumber {_hex: '0x73a20d0c', _isBigNumber: true}\r\nmaxPriorityFeePerGas: BigNumber {_hex: '0x73a20d00', _isBigNumber: true}\r\nnonce: 5\r\nr: \"0x6a8fed76397e03a2fc564d18e1ec12abdf39a38fbe825df990f744bb50fc4a8b\"\r\ns: \"0x66e9b4513047b65aac724dc6fb07d069967f6ca6fd8cd5fe85f6dbe495864765\"\r\nto: \"0x9719E9dC77A7eDD3825844c77a68c896d4a7BB2b\"\r\ntransactionIndex: null\r\ntype: 2\r\nv: 0\r\nvalue: BigNumber {_hex: '0x00', _isBigNumber: true}\r\nwait: confirmations => {…}\r\nlength: 1\r\nname: \"\"\r\narguments: (…)\r\ncaller: (…)\r\n[[FunctionLocation]]: index.ts:336\r\n[[Prototype]]: ƒ ()\r\n[[Scopes]]: Scopes[4]\r\n[[Prototype]]: Object\r\n```\r\nWhen I tried my contract's functions on Remix IDE, all worked as expected.

One of them is an [ERC1363 payable token](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1363) with `transferAndCall(address,uint256,bytes)` function, and the second one is a token receiver whose `buy(address,uint,uint,bytes3)` function call I need to encode off-chain and send to the token's `transferAndCall` function `bytes` parameter. The ERC1363 contract transfers tokens from sender's account to the receiver smart contract's account and then within the same transaction calls receiver's `onTransferReceived(address,address,uint256,bytes)`, where the last `bytes` parameter should be encoded `buy` function call.\r\n\r\nThis is my receiver smart contract:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract TokenReceiver is IERC1363Receiver {\r\n  IERC1363 acceptedToken;\r\n    \r\n  constructor(IERC1363 _acceptedToken) {\r\n    acceptedToken = _acceptedToken;\r\n  }\r\n  event PurchaseMade(address indexed sender, uint tokensPaid, uint productAmount, bytes3 color);\r\n    \r\n  function buy(address sender, uint tokensPaid, uint productAmount, bytes3 color) public {\r\n    // allowed to be called only via the accepted token\r\n    require(msg.sender == address(acceptedToken), \"I accept purchases in Payable Tokens\");\r\n    emit PurchaseMade(sender, tokensPaid, productAmount, color);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function onTransferReceived(address operator, address sender, uint256 tokensPaid, bytes calldata data) external override (IERC1363Receiver) returns (bytes4) {\r\n      // TODO: decode calldata and call `buy` function\r\n    return this.onTransferReceived.selector;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how I assemble the calldata by encoding the signature and params of the `buy` function together:\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  it('buyer should be able to pay tokens and buy products in one transaction', async () => {\r\n    // TokenReceiver `buy` function signature hash: 0x85f16ff4\r\n    const buySigHash = tokenReceiver.interface.getSighash('buy');\r\n    // providing some product properties to the TokenReceiver\r\n    const productAmount = 99;\r\n    const color = '0x121212';\r\n    // packing `buy` signature and the properties together\r\n    const calldata = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(\r\n      ['bytes4', 'uint256', 'bytes3'],\r\n      [buySigHash, productAmount, color],\r\n    );\r\n    // pay tokens and buy some products in one tx\r\n    const transferAndCallTx = payableToken\r\n      .connect(buyer)\r\n      ['transferAndCall(address,uint256,bytes)'](tokenReceiver.address, tokenAmount, calldata);\r\n    await expect(transferAndCallTx)\r\n      .to.emit(tokenReceiver, 'PurchaseMade');\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question is:\r\n- How do I decode the calldata inside the receiver's `onTransferReceived` function?\r\n- How do I extract the function signature and the other 2 encoded params, and then call the corresponding function on the receiver?\n\n### Response:",

This course is based on older versions of solidity, truffle, geth, node.js etc. so most of the code written is outdated. I don't have a background in Javascript so I'm learning as I go.\r\n\r\nSo far I have written and ran this code line by line with no issues:\r\n\r\n    Web3 = require('web3')\r\n    web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(\"http://localhost:7545\"))\r\n    accounts = web3.eth.getAccounts()\r\n    solc = require('solc')\r\n    sourceCode = fs.readFileSync('Greetings.sol').toString()\r\n    input = {language: 'Solidity', sources: {['Greetings.sol']: {content: sourceCode}},settings:{outputSelection:{'*':{'*':['*']}}}} \r\n    output = JSON.parse(solc.compile(JSON.stringify(input)))\r\n    contractABI = output.contracts['Greetings.sol']['Greetings'].abi\r\n    byteCode = output.contracts['Greetings.sol']['Greetings'].evm['bytecode'].object\r\n    account0 = (await web3.eth.getAccounts())[0]\r\n    greetingsContract = new web3.eth.Contract([contractABI])\r\n    greetingsDeployed = greetingsContract.deploy({data: '0x' + byteCode}).send({from: account0, gas: 6721975, gasPrice: 1})\r\n\r\nI know exactly what almost each line does but I'm at a loss as to how I will interact with my functions I've written in my 'Greetings.sol' file. The contracts appear in Ganache as contract creations with the byteCode I'm sending. In the course he mentions to use `greetingsInstance = greetingsContract.at(greetingsDeployed.address)` but that is outdated. So finally, how do I create a smart contract instance and interact with my functions? \r\n\r\nBelow I have posted my `greetingsContract`, `greetingsDeployed` and `contractABI` variables for more

I am trying to do this, as I want to retrieve the signer of a request struct using ECDSA and the EIP-712 standard for hashing structs.\r\n\r\nThis is the contract:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/EIP712.sol\";\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract SignatureChecker is EIP712 {\r\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\r\n\r\n    struct Fee {\r\n        address recipient;\r\n        uint256 value;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    struct Request {\r\n        address to;\r\n        address from;\r\n        Fee[] fees;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    bytes32 public TYPEHASH = keccak256(\"Request(address to,address from, Fee[] fees)\");\r\n\r\n    constructor() EIP712(\"SignatureChecker\", \"1\") {}\r\n\r\n    function verify(\r\n        Request calldata request,\r\n        bytes calldata signature,\r\n        address supposedSigner\r\n    ) external view returns (bool) {\r\n        return recoverAddress(request, signature) == supposedSigner;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function recoverAddress(\r\n        Request calldata request,\r\n        bytes calldata signature\r\n    ) public view returns (address) {\r\n        return _hashTypedDataV4(keccak256(encodeRequest(request))).recover(signature);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function encodeRequest(Request calldata request) public view returns (bytes memory) {\r\n        return abi.encode(TYPEHASH, request.to, request.from, request.fees);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI just want to make sure that I am encoding the request correctly in the encodeRequest function. Unfortunately I could not find anything on how to create a typehash of a nested struct. Is the way I am creating the typehash correct?\r\n\r\nWhen I tried out the verify function without the fees property and the different TYPEHASH without the fee, it worked completely fine. However when I try to retrieve the address of a signature of the request struct with the fees array, it returns a wrong address.\r\n\r\nI have also seen an example where someone tried to do this:\r\n\r\n`bytes32 public constant TYPEHASH = keccak256(\"Request(address to,address from, Fee[] fees)Fee(address recipient, uint256 value)\");`\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it also produces a wrong address.\n\n### Response:"
