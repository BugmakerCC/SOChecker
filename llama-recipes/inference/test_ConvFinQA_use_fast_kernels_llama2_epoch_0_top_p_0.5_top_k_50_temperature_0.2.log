The weighted average exercise price per share in 2007 was $60.94, which is an increase of $35.80 from $25.14 in 2005, representing a 143% change over the years. To calculate the change in weighted average exercise price per share from 2005 to 2007, we can use the following formula:

Change in weighted average exercise price per share = (Weighted average exercise price per share in 2007 - Weighted average exercise price per share in 2005) / Weighted average exercise price per share in 2005
